DIGITS is rather a vision than a project. However, it has got kind-of children,
which are linked below.

- The narrative "The third Child", which is due to the vision of DIGITS
- The S&P-ARK project, which was started on 2022-03-24

Before it was started, the S&P-ARK project had drafted the ALP description
(fourth version). ALP is now going to be set into place at the
S&P-ARK/ALPES.

- ALP - Application Layer Protocol
- [S&P-ARK/ALPES](https://github.com/christoph-v/spark) - ALP, Experimental Setup

The S&P-ARK/ALPES project is rather a vision, too, currently. It is assumed the
Experimental Setup of ALP will not be implemented before the year 2030.

However, we have added a page to the Wiki of the S&P-ARK/ALPES project, where we
describe the connection between DIGITS and S&P-ARK:

contemplated the function of the F-117A.
