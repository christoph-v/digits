DIGITS is rather a vision than a project. However, it has got kind-of children,
which are linked below.

- The narrative "The third Child", which is due to the vision of DIGITS
- The S&P-ARK project, which was started on 2022-03-24

Before it was started, the S&P-ARK project had drafted the ALP description
(fourth version). ALP is now being set into place at the ALPES.

- ALP - Application Layer Protocol
- ALPES - ALP, Experimental Setup

contemplated the function of the F-117A.
