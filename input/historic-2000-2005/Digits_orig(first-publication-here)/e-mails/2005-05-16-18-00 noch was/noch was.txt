[May 30, 2003] "Mappers Write Cookbook 1.0 for Web Services." By Susan M. 
Menke. In Government Computer News (May 30, 2003). "The Open GIS 
Consortium Inc. has put together a batch of not-yet time-tested recipes in 
Cookbook 1.0, the first in a planned series about Web map services. The 
Wayland, Mass., consortium's Web Map Service interface specification makes 
a browser overlay -- a maplike raster-graphic image -- of multiple data 
layers from one or more distributed geographic information systems. The 
recipes tell users how to insert a WMS client into various commercial and 
open-source products such as ESRI ArcExplorer and ArcIMS, FreeBSD, 
Intergraph GeoMedia WebMap, Java deegree, Microsoft Internet Information 
Server and University of Minnesota MapServer. A WMS client can be an HTML 
page returned by a WMS server or a browser plug-in using Java or ActiveX 
to connect to different servers. The client can specify which layers to 
display from a specified geographic area, the file formats and the degree 
of transparency..." See details in the news story "OpenGIS Consortium 
Publishes Web Map Server Cookbook." General references in "Geography 
Markup Language (GML)."
