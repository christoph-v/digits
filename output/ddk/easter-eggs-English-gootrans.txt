NOTE 29 August 2020, modified 16 May 2022
=========================================
So far, the "core of the Easter Eggs" was that Walter was both the father of the
children Monika's (which means that I filed the invention disclosures Car Finder
and LISL and handed them over to Siemens) and Veronika's husband - that's about
the real children Christine and Florian with Verena.

We can't keep up this setup because it turned out that the inventor is always
the "mother" of the invention, while the company represents the "father".

So now a "piece of me" would have to be in both Monika and a "Piece of Siemens"
stuck in Walter, although it's actually Walter who "inherited a lot from me".

That's why you shouldn't take playing around with allegories and metaphors
too seriously.

COLOR THEORY
============

- Red .........is the color of love, also the color of God

- Green .......is the color of hope, so also of freedom and the future

- Blue ........is the color of loyalty and friendship

- Yellow ......is the color of envy and jealousy

- Since red is the color of love (that is, of God), you can also use green/blue
 (cyan) as godlessness

- Black .......is the color of fear (of the night) but also of sadness

- White........is the color of innocence


I THE THIRD CHILD - PROLOGUE
============================

AS A GENERAL RULE---

- The "Scene Zero" is a tracking shot that uses 3D graphics and DIGITS
  
- The first scene begins in the 1st family of Walter. This family and theirs
  Development is the actual "main story" of the first part
  
- Coffee break, fortune teller (=old cod): "The third child will save the world",
    this is the basis for the title of the trilogy, however it remains unclear
    who actually is the "third child" now

- There is the first option that Walter is the "Third Child".
    - the second wife calls him "my third child"
    - because of him the dice cup (devil) is driven out of the company
    - he once said: "The company is the world for me"

- There is the second option that the second wife Monika becomes pregnant and
    that this child will be the "third child" (in a sequel)
    This option could apply if we only for the first part
    Find prospects who have to leave out other parts, and if so then
    there is a sequel to the first part.

- The third option is that the first wife once had a third child,
  which she had kept secret from Walter, but which was already in the womb
  died
    - this third child, although dead, saves the bigamist and his
      Relationship with First Wife ("Honesty")

- There is the fourth option, that the company of the second wife Monika, could
  be the third child
    - This company "saves the world" - landscape paintings on the wall

- The fifth option is that the first wife once had a third child
    - this third child then saves - it is not dead, but was in the
      Baby hatch laid - finally the world (in a sequel)

- In fact, the fifth option applies, but that comes very late to
  daylight (in the second part of the third part). Next is only through one
  temporal coincidence proved that Otto could be Walter's third child.

RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHICAL---

- Since the first part is about Walter, and since Walter inherited a lot from me,
  the first part can only be a prologue. I don't want to write a "story about
  me". One way out is to use Walter as a metaphor for "Austria in the
  cold war".

- The bigamist thinks only of himself and "his things" - selfishness
    Red punch donut and wellness hotel stand for love/being accepted
    as an antidote
  
- the dice cup is a funny fellow, he is the devil, but stands
    also for consultants and rating agencies

- The boss also symbolizes God, who removes the devil (dice cup).

- Rainbow stands for reconciliation with God

- "Play of colors":
     *It starts* with the moon, which is colorless (you can see the universe)
     The *initial state* is fear (black)
     From this follows the *problem* distance from God (green/blue)
     *Help* offers love (red) and reconciliation with God (rainbow)
     x) Black Initial State (Fear)
     x) problem (distance from God, egoism) + red solution (love, God)
            results in white (innocence) or rainbow colors (reconciliation with God)
     Walter) green company + red (solution) merge into yellow company (part 2)

TECHNICAL, POLITICAL---

- The "triangle" and the "code table"
    see code table.ods

- The "beamer" is the SB, the green/blue world is the cold war, the
     Bigamist is Austria in the cold war (neutrality)

- Autobiographical:
     - Walter inherited many qualities from me
     

II THE THIRD CHILD - FRIENDSHIP
=================================

AS A GENERAL RULE---

- The "Scene Zero" is a tracking shot that uses 3D graphics and DIGITS
  
- The first scene introduces Conrad Peter. This is the main character
  of the second part

- the prophecy from the prologue could refer to Conrad Peter
    (since he will be the "third child" of both families), but it remains unclear

- Carl-Friedrich says: "It's my world to win a race in go-karts!"
  --> C.P. saves the world (Carl-Friedrich's)

RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHICAL---

- It's about helping others just like that. That also solves your own
    problems

- It's about dealing with God (with love) - Loyalty and jealousy (the
  three primary colors of subtractive color mixing, red, yellow and blue)

- "MyReality" and "Mixed Reality" are similar, a PSI is to a certain extent
    Also say "my reality" if you understand it as a religion or as a soul.

- It is also about the contrast between Heinrich (fortified Christianity) and Walter
  (pacifist Christianity), it's not my concern, for one of the two
  to take a clear position

- "Play of colors":
    *It starts* with Mars, this is red (you can see the red sky)
    The *initial state* is love (red)
    From this follows the *problem* envy/jealousy (yellow)
    *Help* offers loyalty and friendship (blue)
    Love (red) without jealousy (yellow) is divine; to let go
    x) red initial state (love) + yellow problem (envy)
           -> Orange (assassination, war) (Conrad Peter's conflict)
    x) initial state + problem + solution results in "all colors"
    Walter) yellow company + blue (solution) merges into white company (with
              yellow/white deckchair) or or/also green company (subtractive)

TECHNICAL, POLITICAL---

- The "triangle" and the "code table"
   see code table.ods

- Lieserl stands for locating through the network (also against one's own will)
    It also stands for the network ("the operator") itself

- Carl Friedrich stands for the application that locates itself (possibly
    with the help of the network) and then voluntarily passes on this information,
    therefore he is a pilot

- Conrad Peter stands for the change from military application to "Dual
    Use". Then he is "Call Processing", "Connectivity Platform", SMUOS (Mr.F)
    and MrGc (Mr.Cheessy) that is what connects the pilots with the SB (or
    with the D)

- Walter defines the first family as "at home", you can call it the
    Austria's EU accession

- Walter mounts a target on the roof of his house. That can be interpreted
  classified as "Publication of exact 3D geodata with publicly accessible
  chen GPS coordinates in an open format"
  
- Importance of blocks decreases (fall of the iron curtain)

- Autobiographical:
    - Dice cup has found its master (I'm the devil too)
    - Walter has to look for a new company -> yellow/orange (Kapsch)


=====================================================
==================== UNFINISHED THOUGHTS ============
=====================================================


III THE THIRD CHILD - THE MISSION
=================================

AS A GENERAL RULE---

- The "Scene Zero" is a tracking shot that uses 3D graphics and DIGITS
  
- The first scene introduces Otto. This is the main character of the third part

- The prophecy from the prologue could refer to Otto, since in
  Part IIIb reveals that he has been Veronica's third child with Walter
  could be, which put them in a baby hatch.
  However, this fact is not definitively "proven", but results
  arises only from a coincidence in time.

RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHICAL---

- "Playing with colors IIIa":
    *It starts* with the earth, this is blue (you can see the blue sky)
    The *initial state* is Otto's loyalty to his gang (blue)
    Hence the *problem* of infatuation (with someone else)
    *Help* offers hope for the future (green)
    x) blue initial state (loyalty, friendship, youth ties) +
           red problem (infatuation) -> DDK's conflict is magenta
    x) Initial state + problem + solution results in white again

- The "triangle" and the "code table"
   ? still missing

TECHNICAL, POLITICAL---

- You can also make the following equation (from an X3D/VRML point of view)
     Otto = Geo Grid Server (closed src.) = "DIGITS" or similar. (open src.)
     Conrad Peter = DIS = BS Collaborate (closed src.) = "SMUOS/C3P" or similar. (open src.)
    - Since Otto also symbolizes DIGITS, it makes sense if he is the third child
      "he "saves" the world".

- Otto calls Lieserl "Hasi", which can be taken as a hint:
     Siemens Halske = "telecommunications", Lieserl also stands for "the telecom
                      itself"

- Autobiographical:
    - Carl-Friedrich and Lieserl are not really from Walter -->
      Car Finder and LISL actually correspond to a much older patent,
      which was found afterwards and does not come from me.

Periods:
   IIIa: Summer to victory in late summer (rather short)
   IIIb: autumn and winter (immediately afterwards),
         it starts with disappointment and is rather negative
   IIIc: Spring to November, It begins with a departure and ends with
         the victory in October and the funeral in November, a new beginning?

CP is looking for geodata "for a mountain railway" -> finds Otto -> here it is
CP a "tool of God" because he brings Lieserl and Otto together

The duel Otto / C.P. is a VR application -> car racing!

How can C.P. "help" Otto? - MU scenes are more interesting than SU scenes

The "philosophy of SMUOS/C3P and DIGITS" "evolves" in the discussions
between Lieserl, Otto and C.P.

Actually it was DIGITS that didn't have a father because it wasn't due to a
Use Case, but invented based on a FICTIONAL, MILITARY Use Case. This use case
"does not exist". SIMUL-RR, on the other hand, is "actually" the child of a
need (use cases), the SRR Framework is a child of SIMUL-RR and SMUOS/C3P is a
child of the SRR framework. Here I assume that a "wish will have children" and
then not only these children "serve" this one wish, but they serve several "use
cases" (if they have been "laid deeper")

That Otto (i.e. DIGITS) "the third child of Veronika" (i.e. my third child)
be, is simply Veronica's point of view, but also that of reality
has nothing to do. Solely a coincidence in time led to
that Veronica believed that. As such, the entire trilogy is "out of sight
Veronica" but describes a more general reality that it
"out there" actually exists.

"If you steal the data from the 'super rich' and then give it to the highest
bidder resell, you're no better than them"

does Otto have to get the data physically, or is a cyber break-in enough?

The Third Child and Conrad Peter save the world, but die in the process.
Her ashes will be "scattered to all winds"

Leftovers from I+II
     - CP is now dual use (he is adopted by Walter)
     - The children are now out of the house (except for Lieserl, who is still studying)
     - Who is "the third child"?
     - Fate "completes" Walter's "first wife decision"

New in III
     - DDK stands for "DIGITS" and its transition from Google Earth to Open Source
     - DDK is "Dual Use" from the start
     - The end in the graveyard:
        - I used to differentiate between Plan A (the heroes want
          be buried in Bavarian soil) and Plan B (the heroes want
          that their ashes will be scattered to all winds)
        - now I have published ALP on github.com (also DIGITS), i.e.
          the two heroes definitely want their ashes to fly
          is scattered
        - but the ALP document is poorly rendered by github.com
        - ===> the cemetery official who "scattered the ashes to all winds
               should", stumbles over a pile of wheel hubs from different people
               Versions and the ashes fall on the mound of a fresh one
               grave ----> after 5 years a key flower blooms there
               
Roman A.
--------
   close all brackets again before ending the procedure !!!!!
      Third child save the world (the universe)
      Walter is still learning: G and B are two sides of the same coin, women
         can be wise
      "It died - murdered" has yet to be declared
      Walter put his freedom above love
         see Heinrich, who has placed his religion above love
         but God writes straight on crooked lines.
      Heinrich moves away from Monsignor Kaminsky


Color composition:
==================
Initial state + problem + solution = white or "all colors"
old solution is new initial state

I) Black start, blue-green problem, red solution (additive)
   Walter: green company + red solution is yellow company
   
II) Red start, yellow problem, blue solution (subtractive)
   Walter: yellow company + blue solution is green company
   
IIIa) Blue start, red problem, green solution (additive)

IIIb) Green start, magenta problem, black solution (additive)
        magenta = all colors without hope (additive) = disappointment
        black = sadness/depression

IIIc) Black start, magenta/violet problem, green solution (additive)
        violet = red/blue = imposed Lent


Name composition:
==================
DDK is called Otto instead of Werner, but Otto's father's name is Werner
Main characters:
   Walter
   3
   Conrad
   3
   Peter
   Otto
  includes "W3C" and "C3PO"
fathers:
   Walter
   Heinrich
   Werner
  contains "WHW"
  
  
Alternate titles
------------------
The mission
   IIIa: well meant is not always well done
   IIIb: The punishment of God
   IIIc: from thief to bridge builder
