PRELIMINARY NOTE
================

Some of these Easter Eggs are revealed in the framework story. In a
later version if / if we put the story on a broader basis
in order to become famous with it, the framework story will be deleted again.


NOTE August 29, 2020
====================
So far, the "core of the Easter Eggs" was that Walter was both the father of the children
Monikas is (which means that I made the invention reports Car Finder and LISL
at Siemens) as well as Veronika's husband - that’s them
"real" children Christine and Florian with Verena.

We can't keep up with this setup because it turned out that
the inventor is always the "mother" of the invention, while the company is the "father"
represents.

So now a "piece of me" would have to be in Monika as well as in Veronika
stuck and Walter would be "a company in itself" or "the economy", but would have
also "inherited a lot from me".

COLOR THEORY
============

- Red ........ is the color of love, therefore also the color of God

- Green ....... is the color of hope, including freedom and the future

- Blue ....... is the color of loyalty and friendship

- Yellow ....... is the color of envy and jealousy

- Since red is the color of love (i.e. God), you can also use green / blue (cyan)
  interpret as godlessness

- Black ..... is the color of fear (of the night), but also of sadness

- White ........ is the color of innocence



I THE THIRD CHILD - PROLOGUE
============================

AS A GENERAL RULE---

- The "scene zero" is a tracking shot made with 3D graphics and DIGITS
  has to do
  
- The first scene begins in the 1st Walters family. This family and theirs
  Development is the actual "main story" of the first part
  
- Coffee break, fortune teller (= old fellow): "The third child will save the world",
    this is the basis for the title of the trilogy, but it remains unclear
    who is actually the "third child" now

- There is the first option that Walter is the "third child"
    - the second woman calls him "my third child"
    - Because of him, the dice cup (devil) is driven out of the company
    - he once said: "The company is the world for me"

- There is the second option that the second wife Monika becomes pregnant and
    that this child will be the "third child" (in a sequel)
    This option might apply if they were only interested in the first part
    we have to leave out other parts, and if so, then
    there is a different continuation of the first part.

- The third option is that the first woman once had a third child,
  which she had kept secret from Walter, but which was already in the womb
  died
    - this third child, although dead, saves the bigamist and his own
      Relationship with first wife ("honesty")

- There is the fourth option that the company of the second wife Monika is the third
    Could be a child
    - This company "saves the world" - landscape paintings
                                                        on the wall

- The fifth option is that the first woman had a third child at one point or another
    - this third child then saves - it is not dead, but was in the
      Baby flap laid - finally the world (in a sequel)

- In fact, the fifth option applies, but that comes very late to the
  Daylight (in the second part of the third part). Further is only through one
  temporal coincidence proved that Otto could be Walter's third child.

RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHIC ---

- Since the first part is about Walter, and since Walter inherited a lot from me,
  the first part can only be a prologue. I don't want a "story about me ". One
  way out is to use Walter as a metaphor for "Austria in cold war".

- The bigamist only thinks of himself and "his things" - egoism
    Red Punschkrapferl and wellness hotel stand for love / acceptance
    as an antidote
  
- the dice cup is a funny fellow, he is the devil, but stands
    also for consultants and rating agencies

- The boss also symbolizes God, who removes the devil (dice cup).

- Rainbow stands for reconciliation with God

- "Play of colors":
    * It starts * with the moon, this is colorless (you can see space)
    The * initial state * is fear (black)
    From this follows the * problem * distance from God (green / blue)
    * Help * offers love (red) and reconciliation with God (rainbow)
    x) initial black state (fear)
    x) problem (distance from God, egoism) + red solution (love, God)
           results in white (innocence) or rainbow colors (reconciliation with God)
    Walter) green company + red (solution) combines to form yellow company (part 2)

TECHNICAL, POLITICAL ---

- The "triangle" and the "code table"
   see code table.ods

- The "Beamer" is the SB, the green / blue world is the cold war, the
    Bigamist is Austria in the Cold War (neutrality)

- Autobiographical:
    - Walter inherited many traits from me

    
    
II THE THIRD CHILD - FRIENDSHIP
===============================

AS A GENERAL RULE---

- The "scene zero" is a tracking shot made with 3D graphics and DIGITS
  has to do
  
- Conrad Peter is introduced in the first scene. This is the main character of the
  second part

- the prophecy from the prologue could refer to Conrad Peter
  (since he will be the "third child" of both families), but it remains unclear

- Carl-Friedrich says: "It is my world to race once in a go-kart
  win! "-> C.P. saves the world (of Carl-Friedrich)

RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHIC ---

- It's about helping others just like that. That also solves your own
    Problems

- It's about dealing with God (with love) - Faithfulness and jealousy (the
  three basic colors of subtractive color mixing, red, yellow and blue)

- "MyReality" and "Mixed Reality" are similar, a PSI is in a certain way
    Wise "my reality" too, if you see it as religion or as soul.

- It is also about the contrast between Heinrich (defensive Christianity) and Walter
  (pacifist Christianity), I don't care for either of the two
  to take a clear position

- "Play of colors":
    * It starts * with Mars, this is red (you can see the red sky)
    The * initial state * is love (red)
    From this follows the * problem * envy / jealousy (yellow)
    * Help * offers loyalty and friendship (blue)
    Love (red) without jealousy (yellow) is divine; let go
    x) red initial state (love) + yellow problem (envy)
           -> Orange (assassination attempt, war) (Conrad Peters conflict)
    x) problem + blue solution (loyalty, friendship) results in white (innocence)
    Walter) yellow company + blue (solution) combines to white company (with
              yellow / white deck chair) or / also green company (subtractive)
    
TECHNICAL, POLITICAL ---

- The "triangle" and the "code table"
   see code table.ods

- Lieserl stands for tracking by the network (even against your own will)
    It also stands for the network ("the operator") itself

- Carl Friedrich stands for the application that locates itself (possibly
    with the help of the network), and then voluntarily passes this information on,
    that's why he's a pilot

- Conrad Peter stands for the change from military application to "dual
    Use ". Then he is" Call Processing "," Connectivity Platform ", SMUOS (Mr.F)
    and MrGc (Mr.Cheessy) that is what connects the pilots with the SB (resp.
    with the D)

- Walter defines the first family as "at home", that can be called that
    Interpreting Austria's accession to the EU

- Walter mounts a target on the roof of his house. You can interpret that
  as "publication of exact 3D geodata with publicly accessible
  GPS coordinates in an open format "
  
- The importance of the blocks is decreasing (fall of the iron curtain)

- Autobiographical:
    - dice cup has found its master (I'm the devil too)
    - Walter has to look for a new company -> yellow / orange (Kapsch)

==================== UNFINISHED THOUGHTS ============

III THE THIRD CHILD - THE MISSION
=================================

AS A GENERAL RULE---

- The "scene zero" is a tracking shot made with 3D graphics and DIGITS
  has to do
  
- The first scene introduces Otto. This is the main character of the third part

- The prophecy from the prologue could relate to Otto, as part of
  IIIb reveals that he was Veronica's third child with Walter
  could, which put this in a baby hatch.
  However, this fact is not definitively "proven", but results
  only from a temporal coincidence.

RELIGIOUS, PHILOSOPHIC ---

- "Play of colors IIIa":
    * It starts * with the earth, this is blue (you can see the blue sky)
    The * initial state * is Otto's loyalty to his gang (blue)
    From this follows the * problem * being in love (with someone else)
    * Help * offers hope for the future (green)
    x) blue initial state (loyalty, friendship, youth ties) +
           red problem (infatuation) -> DDK's conflict is magenta
    x) Problem + green (solution) does not produce white but yellow, part IIIa is
           so not "self-contained"

- The "triangle" and the "code table"
   ? still missing

TECHNICAL, POLITICAL ---

- The following equation can also be made (from X3D / VRML point of view)
     Otto = Geo Grid Server (closed src.) = "DIGITS" or similar (open src.)
     Conrad Peter = DIS = BS Collaborate (closed src.) = "SMUOS / C3P" or similar (open src.)
    - Since Otto also symbolizes DIGITS, it makes sense if he is the third child
      "the world saves" (he "saves" the world).

- Otto calls Lieserl "Hasi", which can be taken as a hint:
     Siemens Halske = "telecommunications", Lieserl also stands for "the
     telecommunications communication "per se

- Autobiographical:
    - In reality, Carl-Friedrich and Lieserl are not from Walter ->
      Car Finder and LISL actually correspond to a much older patent,
      which was found in retrospect and does not come from me.

Periods:
   IIIa: Summer until victory in late summer (rather short)
   IIIb: autumn and winter (immediately afterwards),
         it starts with disappointment and is more negative
   IIIc: Spring to November, It starts with a departure and ends with
         the victory in October and the memorial in November, a new beginning?

C.P. searches geodata "for a mountain range" -> finds Otto -> here it is
C.P. a "tool of God" because it brings Lieserl and Otto together

The duel Otto / C.P. is a VR application -> car racing!

How can C.P. Otto "help"? - MU scenes are more interesting than SU scenes

The "philosophy of SMUOS / C3P and DIGITS" "develops" in the discussions
between Lieserl, Otto and C.P.

Actually it was DIGITS that didn't have a father because it wasn't because of one
Use cases, but invented on the basis of a FICTIVE, MILITARY use case
has been. This use case "does not exist". SIMUL-RR, however, is "actually"
the child of a need (use cases), the SRR Framework is a child of
SIMUL-RR and SMUOS / C3P is a child of the SRR framework. Here I assume
from the fact that a "wish has children" and then these children not only this one
"Serve" a wish, but several "Use Cases" (if you can "deepen."
has laid ")

That Otto (i.e. DIGITS) "the third child of Veronica" (i.e. my third child)
is simply Veronica's point of view, but also that of reality
has nothing to do. Only a temporal coincidence led to
that Veronika believed that. In this respect, the entire trilogy is "from the point of view
Veronikas "written, but describes a more general reality that it
"out there" actually exists.

"If you steal the data from the 'super-rich' and then give it to the best bidder
resell, you are not a bit better than them "

does Otto physically fetch the data, or is a cyber break-in enough?

The third child and Conrad Peter save the world, but they die in the process.
Their ashes will be "scattered to the wind"

Remnants of I + II
     - C.P. is now dual use (he is adopted by Walter)
     - Walter is now retired (really ???)
     - The children are out of the house now (except Lieserl, who is still studying)
     - Who is "the third child"?
     - Fate "completes" Walter's "decision for the first wife"

New in III
     - DDK stands for "DIGITS" and its change from Google Earth to Open Source
     - DDK is "Dual Use" from the start
     - The end in the cemetery:
        - I used to differentiate between Plan A (the heroes want
          to be buried in Bavarian soil) and Plan B (the heroes want
          that their ashes will be scattered to the wind)
        - now I have published ALP on github.com (also DIGITS), i.e.
          the two heroes definitely want their ashes to be scattered to
          the wind
        - but the .pdf with ALP cannot be displayed by github.com
        - ===> the cemetery official who "should scatter the ashes" to the wind
               stumbles over a heap of different versions of wheel hubs and the
               ashes fall on the hill of soil on a fresh one grave
               ----> after 5 years blooms there ?????????? 

Roman A.
--------
   close all brackets again before ending the procedure !!!!!
   ---> TO DO
      Third child save the world (the universe)
      Walter is still learning: G and B are two sides of the same coin, women
         can be wise
      "It died - murdered" has yet to be declared
      Walter put his freedom above love
         see Heinrich, who has placed his religion above love
         but God writes straight on crooked lines.
   -> DONE
      Heinrich moves away from Monsignor Kaminsky


Color composition:
=================
Problem + solution = white
old solution is new initial state

I) Black beginning, blue-green problem, red solution (additive)
   Walter: green company + red solution is yellow company
   
II) Red beginning, yellow problem, blue solution (subtractive)
   Walter: yellow company + blue solution is white company
   
IIIa) Blue beginning, red problem, green solution (additive)
   but problem + solution is not white, but yellow

IIIb) Green beginning, red problem, black solution (subtractive)
        red = all colors without hope (subtractive) = disappointment
        black = sadness
   but problem + solution is not white, but dark red

IIIc) Black beginning, purple problem, green solution (additive)
        purple = red / blue = imposed fasting period
   Problem (magenta) + solution (green) = white, now the result is correct again


Name composition:
===================
DDK is called Otto instead of Werner, but Otto's father is called Werner
Main characters:
   Walter
   3
   Conrad
   3
   Peter
   Otto
  contains "W3C" and "C3PO"
Father:
   Walter
   Heinrich
   Werner
  contains "WHW"
  
  
Alternative title
-----------------
The mission
   IIIa: Well meant is not always well done
   IIIb: God's punishment
   IIIc: from thief to bridge builder
